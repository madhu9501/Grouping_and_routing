# Grouping and Routing

This code is designed to group multiple coordinates (representing employees) with a single destination. It uses two distinct approaches for grouping:

1. **K-means Clustering**  
   Utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to group employees based on proximity, optimizing routes for each cluster.

2. **Custom Grouping Algorithm**  
   Implements a custom grouping algorithm that caters to specific business needs, allowing more flexibility compared to standard algorithms.
